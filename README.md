# Changes to U-Net block:

1. Use of skip connections.

2. Use of GlobalMaxPool2D instead of MaxPool2D.

3. Use of Spatial Excitations.

4. Use of PRelu and Leaky Relus.

Scope of improvement: Yes!

Please feel free to suggest tips for improvement!

# Suggested Tips:

1. Use class weights.

3. Use Custom Image Augmentation on Tranining Data.

2. Try other models like PSPNet.
